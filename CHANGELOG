    feature (client) - introduce all ship types
    bugfix (server) - defenders can't be bumped into the island safe zone
    bugfix (server) - bilge values seem low: both damage threshold for bilge creep, and also the ratcheting increment rate (between 30%-60% per turn) seems way too high.
    bugfix (server) - resets rapidly (like 10x a second) until a player times out while registering. (fixed: the presence of an unregistered player would start a game, but the lack of a registered player would stop one)
    bugfix (server) - People are kicked for timing out while animating while on power save mode. (Mitigation: option to disable powersave mode)
    bugfix (server) - gunners should fill at some percentage of max cannons (e.g: 75% of all available per turn) rather than constant number of cannons (i.e. 10.5)

    bugfix (server) - Whenever a wind blows a big ship onto a little ship., the big ship takes the little ship's spot. (closed as cant replicate)
    bugfix (server) - investigated guns, sails being too fast to load but actually these numbers seem reasonable, no action taken.
1.9.7
    bugfix (server) - provide consistent error codes

    bugfix (client) - moves didn't drag properly from valid slot to invalid slot. they should have been removed from the valid slot. They weren't.

    bugfix (server) - help message for parameter set exceeded max message length and wasn't sendable
    bugfix (client) - click area is whole of gun area even if small ship (not a bug - this is genuine PP behaviour)
    bugfix (server) - inaccurate reporting of number of players present
        should work off players and registered/not

    feature (server) - vote on sink delay and disengage button behavior
    feature (server) - variable disengage button behaviors (simple, off, realistic)

1.9.6
    bugfix (client) - want to move seamlessly from old res to new res when changing
